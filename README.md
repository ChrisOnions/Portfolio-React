## Aim

Being a web developer means being part of a community. I needed a place not only to share your projects while im applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share my work with other developers and collaborate on projects.

I create a portfolio using my new React skills, which will help set me apart from other developers whose portfolios donâ€™t use the latest technologies.
